In this article, we're going through the functionalities of the Online Archive. We'll describe its key features (and limitations). You'll also see some guides about Online Archiving.

## When do I need Online Archive?

Depending on our email activity, we might reach the point our mailbox is very big. It comes with several implications.

Our Outlook might start getting slower and slower. We might start getting alerts from our administrator saying that our mailbox will soon reach its quota.

Is there a way to sort this out? Of course, it is! Its name is Online Archive.

## What is Outlook Online Archive?

Online Archive is an additional storage space in Exchange Online. It's optimized to store our old emails.

We're not going to access emails stored in the archive daily. Thus, they can be stored online and not use our disk space. That's why it's called *Online Archive*.

## How can I check if I have an Online Archive?

Online Archive is visible as an additional mailbox in our Outlook. We can distinguish that based on its name.

## What is the difference between Online Archive and archive in Outlook?

Our Outlook can also have a mailbox called *Archives*. If we see it on our list, we have local archiving enabled:

Local archiving stores data on our disk. That means - we need to take care of the backup. The data is no longer protected by Exchange mechanisms. An example of such a mechanism is replication to multiple databases.

The local archive can still be useful in some cases. For example, some of our folders might have data about old projects. The projects already ended and we don't need the data in our mailbox. We can archive it to a local file and store it in the secure location

  If you want to learn how to enable local archiving, I mention it in one of my articles. Its name is [6 ways to clean up Outlook mailbox](/outlook-mailbox-clean-up).
