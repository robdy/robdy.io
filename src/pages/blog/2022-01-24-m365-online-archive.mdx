In this article, we're going through the functionalities of the Online Archive. We'll describe its key features (and limitations). You'll also see some guides about Online Archiving.

## When do I need Online Archive?

Depending on our email activity, we might reach the point our mailbox is very big. It comes with several implications.

Our Outlook might start getting slower and slower. We might start getting alerts from our administrator saying that our mailbox will soon reach its quota.

Is there a way to sort this out? Of course, it is! Its name is Online Archive.

## What is Outlook Online Archive?

Online Archive is an additional storage space in Exchange Online. It's optimized to store our old emails.

We're not going to access emails stored in the archive daily. Thus, they can be stored online and not use our disk space. That's why it's called *Online Archive*.

## How can I check if I have an Online Archive?

Online Archive is visible as an additional mailbox in our Outlook. We can distinguish that based on its name.

## What is the difference between Online Archive and archive in Outlook?

Our Outlook can also have a mailbox called *Archives*. If we see it on our list, we have local archiving enabled:

Local archiving stores data on our disk. That means - we need to take care of the backup. The data is no longer protected by Exchange mechanisms. An example of such a mechanism is replication to multiple databases.

The local archive can still be useful in some cases. For example, some of our folders might have data about old projects. The projects already ended and we don't need the data in our mailbox. We can archive it to a local file and store it in the secure location

If you want to learn how to enable local archiving, I mention it in one of my articles. Its name is [6 ways to clean up Outlook mailbox](/outlook-mailbox-clean-up).

## What is the size of an Online Archive?

The size of the Online Archive mailbox depends on the license.

You can find the most accurate list in Microsoft documentation. Refer to [*Mailbox storage limits* section of Exchange Online service description](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-service-description/exchange-online-limits#mailbox-storage-limits).

At the moment of writing, 50GB of archive storage is available for:

* Microsoft 365 Business Basic
* Microsoft 365 Business Standard
* Office 365 Enterprise E1

The archive mailbox is not available for Office 365 Enterprise F3.

1.5TB of archive storage is available for:

* Microsoft 365 Business Premium
* Office 365 Enterprise E3
* Office 365 Enterprise E5

If we have these licenses we'll receive auto-expanding archive. Its initial size will be 100GB. When the archive mailbox reaches the quota, additional 100GBs will be added. It doesn't require contacting Microsoft (that was the case in the past).

### Note about auto-expanding archives

We can have 1.5TB of mail storage for a single mailbox. Amazing, isn't it?

Some people might think about buying a single license to store multiple archives at once. I'm not saying it's you. But, if you know anyone who came up with that idea, warn them!

Here's what Microsoft states about such a case:

> Using journaling, transport rules, or auto-forwarding rules to copy messages to an Exchange Online mailbox for the purposes of archiving is not permitted. A user's archive mailbox is intended for just that user. **Microsoft reserves the right to deny additional archive storage space** in instances where a user's archive mailbox is used to store archive data for other users or in other cases of inappropriate use.
