I have recently received a ticket saying ‘I cannot create a group form in MS Forms'. It was a bit surprising to me - I don't receive tickets about Forms very frequently.

Quick checking on my account didn't help. I followed the steps easily and created the form for my test group. But then I tried on my admin account. It was my first time using Forms there. And voilà - I got the same issue.

## Issue

According to the [Create a group form or quiz](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-group-form-or-quiz-7228eebb-a6ab-45ec-8123-52026a2f52ff), you need to go to MS Forms and then scroll down to see **My groups** section:

![The instruction in the Microsoft article is straightforward](../../img/my-groups-missing-ms-forms/20221207-150447-cvqfofDoK4.png)

However, when you open Microsoft Forms, you see the following page:

![Starting page without the ‘My groups' section](../../img/my-groups-missing-ms-forms/20221221-155932-jP5beUgEVp.png)

The page doesn't have the **My groups** section.

## Solution

Create an empty form and save it. Once you have your first form, you'll see a different welcome screen. Follow the steps below:

Click the **New Form** button:

Close the new tab:

Go to[forms.office.com](https://forms.office.com) once again. You'll see another welcome page:

Scroll down and you'll find **My Groups** section:

## Not-so-easy-to-notice button

In some cases, you will also see the **Go to Forms** button in the top-right corner. It's not so easy to notice. It took me a few attempts to find out it's there. If you have a button, you don't need to create an empty form. Simply click the button and you'll be redirected:

## Summary

The solution for this issue was quite quick. One important lesson from it - sometimes the interface is not the same when you use the service for the first time.
