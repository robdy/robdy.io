## Prerequisites

To go through the article we need to have our development environment. There are two main ways to create the environment: locally and using Remote Development Containers.

If you want to use your local environment, follow the article [Minimal Path to Awesome](https://github.com/pnp/cli-microsoft365/wiki/Minimal-Path-to-Awesome). For Remote Development Containers, follow [GitHub Codespaces & Visual Studio Remote Development Container](https://github.com/pnp/cli-microsoft365/wiki/GitHub-Codespaces-&-Visual-Studio-Remote-Development-Container).

In this article we'll be using the environment based on GitHub Codespaces.

## Building the project

Each time we make the changes, we need to rebuild the project.

We do it by running the following command:

```shell
npm run build
```
