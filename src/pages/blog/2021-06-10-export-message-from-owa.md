## Limitations

Using Outlook Web App to save messages comes with some limitations. The most important one is that we're not able to choose the format of the message. For example, **we cannot save the email in `.msg` format**. The only format available is `.eml`.

Saving multiple messages at once is not possible out of the box. As a workaround, we can send the message to ourselves.
