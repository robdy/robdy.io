This blog post was inspired by Microsoft Message Center announcement MC316139. It says about changes in number assignment via PowerShell.

The announcement points 3 cmdlets to be fully retired. It also mentioned one cmdlet to be deprecated only for number assignment.

## How to find where we use the cmdlets?



## Full script

```powershell
$cmdletsToBeChecked = @"
Set-CsUser
Set-CsOnlineVoiceUser
Set-CsOnlineApplicationInstance
Set-CsOnlineVoiceApplicationInstance
"@ -split "`n"

Get-ChildItem . -File -Recurse -Filter "*.ps1" | Select-String -Pattern ($cmdletsToBeChecked -join "|")
```
