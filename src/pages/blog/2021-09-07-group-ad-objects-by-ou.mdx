Grouping objects by Organizational Unit might be helpful for preparing reports or stats for our directory. Let's learn how we can do it using PowerShell

## Getting objects

First, let's grab all the objects we'd like to group. Some example cmdlets we can use:

```powershell
# Gets all the computers
$objects = Get-AdComputer -Filter *

# Gets all the users
$objects = Get-AdUser -Filter *
```

## Finding the OU

Now we need to find the value of the organizational unit for each object in the array.

### Distinguished name

We can first check if there's any property we could use out-of-the-box.

```powershell
$objects[0].OU
$objects[0].OrganizationalUnit
# Return nothing
```

Apparently, such property doesn't exist. However, we could use `DistinguishedName` property.

The format of `DistinguishedName` property is similar to the below:

```
CN=ObjectName,OU=Unit1A,OU=Unit1,DC=domain,DC=com
```

The values represent:

* `CN=ObjectName` is the name of the particular object
* `OU=Unit` is for OU structure, starting from the bottom. Top-level OUs are listed last
* `DC=domain,DC=com` is for Active Directory domain name

### Removing CN part

Based on the values from `DistinguishedName` the easiest way to find the OU would be to strip the first part `CN=xxxxx,` and group by that value. We could use [calculated property](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_calculated_properties?view=powershell-7.1) to achieve this.

Let's try to replace the first part with [a regular expression](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_regular_expressions?view=powershell-7.1):

```powershell
$objects | Select-Object @{n="OU";e={$_.DistinguishedName -replace "CN=.*,",""}}
```

The output will be a very long list of something like:

```powershell
DC=internal
DC=internal
DC=internal
# and so on
```

Why is that? Let's start from the very beginning. [PowerShell is based on .NET](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/professional-windows-powershell/9780471946939/9780471946939_windows_powershell_and_the_.net_framewor.html). Therefore, regular expressions [use the .NET implementation](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/powershell_perl_regex/).

In this implementation, regex quantifiers are greedy by default. In contrary to lazy quantifiers, the greedy ones try to match as many characters as possible.

In our example, `CN=` is matched based on character matching. Next, the `*` quantifier matches as many other characters as it can, provided they are followed by `,`. 

So, how to match minimal number of characters? You can probably guess - we need to change the quantifier to be lazy by adding `?` character! We want our * quantifier to be lazy. We don't need to apply the same mechanism for characters we use. It'd not have any effect anyway.

> If you want to learn more about quantifiers check [Quantifiers in Regular Expressions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/quantifiers-in-regular-expressions) article provided by Microsoft.

Our code will now be:

```powershell
$objects | Select-Object @{n="OU";e={$_.DistinguishedName -replace "CN=.*?,",""}}
```

And the output will be:

```powershell
OU=Unit1A,OU=Unit1,DC=domain,DC=com
OU=Unit1B,OU=Unit1,DC=domain,DC=com
OU=Unit2A,OU=Unit2,DC=domain,DC=com
OU=Unit1B,OU=Unit1,DC=domain,DC=com
# and so on
```

## Grouping objects

Now we only need to group (and possibly sort) the OU names we got from the previous step. Let's save the output to a variable and use Group-Object and Sort-Object:

```powershell
# Saving output from previous step
$ous = $objects | Select-Object @{n="OU";e={$_.DistinguishedName -replace "CN=.*?,",""}}
# Groupping
$groupped = $ous | Group-Object OU -NoElement
# And sorting
$groupped | Sort-Object Count -Descending
```

The output will be:

```powershell
Count Name
----- ----
  100 OU=Unit1B,OU=Unit1,DC=domain,DC=com
   21 OU=Unit1A,OU=Unit1,DC=domain,DC=com
   15 OU=Unit2A,OU=Unit2,DC=domain,DC=com
# and so on
```

Now we have stats and we can export or work on them further
