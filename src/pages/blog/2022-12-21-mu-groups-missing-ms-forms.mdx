I have recently received a ticket saying ‘I cannot create a group form in MS Forms'. It was a bit surprising to me - I don't receive tickets about Forms very frequently.

Quick checking on my account didn't help. I followed the steps easily and created the form for my test group. But then I tried on my admin account. It was my first time using Forms there. And voilà - I got the same issue.
