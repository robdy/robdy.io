## Checklist

* Have backup producer
* Prepare a transcript/action plan

## Scheduling

Open **Calendar** tab in your Teams client, verify if you see the arrow next to **New meeting** and start scheduling the event:

### Title and time

The title you set will be displayed to your attendees. Avoid using phrases like *Presenter invite*, *Moderator invite for event*.

### Meeting options

### Roles

Full description of the available roles can be found [in the docs](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/get-started-with-microsoft-teams-live-events-d077fec2-a058-483e-9ab5-1494afda578a#bkmk_roles). Here I'm highlighting most important informations and tips based on my experience.

#### Organizer

The person who schedules Live Event. He/she is the only one who can:

* Change meeting options (e.g. add Q&A, edit recording/captions settings)
* Add more **producers** (presenters can be added ad-hoc)
* Downgrade permissions from producer to presenter (scroll down to tips to see why it's important)
* Change Live Event permissions (e.g. change org-wide event to public event)

By default, organizer has producer rights (unless they explicitly downgrade it).

#### Producers

People who start/stop the meeting and manage what's visible to attendees. It's important to have at least two producers in case one of them is, for some reason (network issues, doorbell ringing), unable to operate the content. In general, try to avoid being both producer and presenter in the same time due to high system resources usage.

#### Presenters

They can:

* Present their desktop/application
* Share voice and video (including dialing-in via PSTN conferencing feature, if available)
* Manage Q&A section

#### Moderator

You won't find that role in Live Event configuration wizard. However, based on my experience, it's very useful to have dedicated person who can take care of the questions:

* Publish or dismiss them
* Reply privately
* Reply publicly via moderator announcement
* During Q&A session read the most voted questions to the main presenter

\########### TO BE VERIFIED IF MODERATORS AND PRESENTERS CAN BE ADDED AD-HOC AND SEE Q&A #######

#### Permissions

## Tips

### Dial-in users are not in the report

### Dial-in users join unmuted (to be confirmed)

### Don't share producer and presenter role

### Avoid last minute changes
