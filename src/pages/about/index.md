My name is Robert Dyjas. I'm Microsoft Teams and Skype for Business specialist who also likes to learn `$newThings` in the meantime.

Current values of `$newThings` for me is `[JavaScript, Web Development, CSS]`. It might be subject to change frequently.

Since the beginning of my career I'm working with Microsoft products. I'm mainly focused on communication tools: Teams, Skype for Business and Exchange.

### Projects

I've been participating in various non-commercial projects in the past.

### Blog

On this blog I include some random hints/instructions about the issues I have resolved and decided to note so I don't have to search for the information once again. I'm glad if you find it somewhat useful!
