My name is Robert Dyjas. I'm Microsoft Teams and Skype for Business specialist who also likes to learn `$newThings` in the meantime.

Current values of `$newThings` for me is `[JavaScript, Web Development, CSS]`. It might be subject to change frequently.

Since the beginning of my career I'm working with Microsoft products. I'm mainly focused on communication tools: Teams, Skype for Business and Exchange.
