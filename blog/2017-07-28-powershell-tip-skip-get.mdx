  In PowerShell you can skip the verb “Get” (at least for most cmdlets – it isn't working for things like Get-Process).

Interesting thing which I discovered today (BTW, SysAdmin day).

Instead of using

``` powershell
Get-Mailbox yourname@domain.com
```

you can just use
``` powershell
Mailbox yourname@domain.com
```

It looks like it’s not an alias as Get-Alias cmdlet doesn’t show anything for these noun-only cmdlets.

~~Unfortunately it has one significant drawback: Tab completion/Intellisense in ISE will not be working with such cmdlets which makes them quite useless. But for ad-hoc checking can be helpful.~~

### Update 2018-12-06:

After digging a bit more I found far more information about that default verb feature. First of all, I check if that is something built into some modules so I tried cmdlets from multiple modules:

``` powershell
service
aduser mySan
ExcelColumnName # random cmdlet from ImportExcel module
```

The only cmdlet I cannot run is 

```powershell
process
```

But it's due to conflict with `begin process end`.

I also discovered that tab completion apparently works (in contrary to what I wrote in that post previously) but only for parameters, not for cmdlets.

### How I investigated?

As stated in [About Command Precedence](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_command_precedence?view=powershell-6):

> If you do not specify a path, PowerShell uses the following precedence
> order when it runs commands:
> 
>   1. Alias
>   1. Function
>   1. Cmdlet
>   1. Native Windows commands

Checking one by one (based on `Get-Service`):

``` powershell
# Checking for alias
PS C:\> Get-Alias service
Get-Alias : This command cannot find a matching alias because an alias
with the name 'service' does not exist.

# Checking for function
PS C:\> Get-Command -Name service -CommandType Function
Get-Command : The term 'service' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet,
function, script file, or operable program. Check the spelling of the name,
or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.

# Checking for cmdlet
PS C:\> Get-Command -Name service -CommandType Cmdlet
Get-Command : The term 'service' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, 
function, script file, or operable program. Check the spelling of the name,
or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.
```

Next in cmd (for native Windows commands):

```powershell
C:\>service
'service' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```

### What next?

What gave me the answer was searching in [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com). First interesting thing I found was [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/44476385/9902555):

> If the command name does *not* contain a dash or a slash, and no command has been found after exhausting the last option in the list above, it'll try again, but [with `Get-` prepended](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/02b5f357a20e6dee9f8e60e3adb9025be3c94490/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/CommandDiscovery.cs#L1193).

And below, there's an explanation [why `Get-Command` doesn't follow that logic](https://stackoverflow.com/a/44477329/9902555).
