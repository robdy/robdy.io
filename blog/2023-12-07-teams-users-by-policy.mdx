Together with my colleague, Nuhu, I recently discussed getting users with certain Teams policy. Below I'm sharing tips on how to achieve this the optimal way.

## Standard way

Let's say we want to find all users with the policy assigned. We know the policy type (in the example below *TeamsEventsPolicy*). We also know the name (in the example it is *Allow Town Halls*)

```powershell
Get-CsOnlineUser |
	Where-Object TeamsEventsPolicy -like "Allow Town Halls"
```

Let's look at the performance of this approach.

Above we used *Get-CsOnlineUser* and then piped the result to *Where-Object*. This means we pull all the users to memory. We filter them afterward. That is not a big deal for small environments. But what if we have thousands of users in the organization?

Let's check!

## Using Filter parameter

Let's modify our script to use *-Filter* parameter instead. We can use the `-eq` operator now

```powershell
Get-CsOnlineUser -Filter "TeamsEventsPolicy -like 'Allow Town Halls'"
```

## Testing the performance

Now we will add some measurements to test the performance. We will also extract the policy type and name to variables for easier modification:

```powershell
# Modify here and it will apply to both cmdlets
$policyType = 'TeamsEventsPolicy'
$policyName = 'Allow Town Halls'

$whereTime = Measure-Command -Expression {
	$resUsingWhere = Get-CsOnlineUser |
		Where-Object $policyType -like $policyName
}
$filterTime = Measure-Command -Expression {
	$resUsingFilter = Get-CsOnlineUser -Filter "$policyType -like '$policyName'"
}
Write-Host "Using where:  $([math]::round($whereTime.TotalMilliseconds))"
Write-Host "Using filter: $([math]::round($filterTime.TotalMilliseconds))"
```

![Using filter was 40 milliseconds faster](../../img/teams-users-by-policy/20231204-092236-ZcSUFOomLz.png)

40 milliseconds - this is nothing. But what happens if we have more users in the organization - let's say more than 300k. And 10k of them have the policy assigned. The difference is more remarkable: 92 seconds using *Filter* and more than 2500 seconds (42 minutes) using *Where-Object*:

![Performance comparison for a large number of users](../../img/teams-users-by-policy/2023-12-04_11_13_47-000800.png)

When we specify the policy with only one user, the difference is huge. Using *Filter* finished in 2 seconds. I was not patient enough to wait another 40 mins ðŸ˜‰. I simply assumed the execution time would be similar. The script needs to pull all the users anyway.

## Equality operator

You might wonder why we use `-like` instead of `-eq` in the examples above. The reason is that its behavior is not consistent for getting policies. When using *Where-Object*:

```powershell
# This works
Where-Object $policyType -like $policyName
# While those do not work
Where-Object $policyType -eq $policyName
Where-Object $policyType -eq "host:$policyName"
Where-Object $policyType -eq "tenant:$policyName"
```

<Tip>

The word *tenant* before the policy name is for custom policies. The ones provided by Microsoft will have the word *host*.

</Tip>

To make *Where-Object* work we would need to filter by *Name property:*

```powershell
# This won't work as we access nested property
Get-CsOnlineUser |
	Where-Object $policyType.name -eq $policyName
# We need to use expression
Get-CsOnlineUser |
	Where-Object {$_.$policyType.name -eq $policyName}
```

With *Filter* it is easier:

```powershell
# All of those work
Get-CsOnlineUser -Filter "$policyType -eq '$policyName'"
Get-CsOnlineUser -Filter "$policyType -like '$policyName'"
Get-CsOnlineUser -Filter "$policyType -like 'tenant:$policyName'"
Get-CsOnlineUser -Filter "$policyType -like 'host:$policyName'"
```

## Comparison statement or script block

When using script block for filtering we wrap it in curly braces `{ ... }`. For some simple cases, we could also use a comparison statement:

```powershell
[PROPERTY] -[operator] [value]
```

Those two examples are equivalent:

```powershell
# Comparison statement
Get-CsOnlineUser |
		Where-Object $policyType -like $policyName
# Script block
Get-CsOnlineUser |
		Where-Object {$_.$policyType -like $policyName}
```

I did not notice any performance difference between the comparison statement and the script block.

## Comparison statement for Filter property

There are plenty of filters that work properly with *Get-CsOnlineUser*. To return users with a specified policy we can use both `-like` and `-eq`:

```powershell
$policyType = 'TeamsEventsPolicy'
$policyName = 'Allow Town Halls'
# Return users with the specified policy
Get-CsOnlineUser -Filter "$policyType -like '$policyName'"
Get-CsOnlineUser -Filter "$policyType -eq '$policyName'"
```

```powershell
$policyType = 'TeamsEventsPolicy'
$policyName = 'Allow Town Halls'
# Return users with the specified policy
Get-CsOnlineUser -Filter "$policyType -like '$policyName'"
Get-CsOnlineUser -Filter "$policyType -eq '$policyName'"
```

For `-like` wildcards are supported:

```powershell
# Includes all policies starting with 'Allow Town Halls'
Get-CsOnlineUser -Filter "$policyType -like '$policyName*'"
# Ending with 'Allow Town Halls'
Get-CsOnlineUser -Filter "$policyType -like '*$policyName'"
# Or containing 'Allow Town Halls'
Get-CsOnlineUser -Filter "$policyType -like '*$policyName*'"
```

*Tenant* and *host* types work, too:

```powershell
# Users with global policy are not returned in any case below
Get-CsOnlineUser -Filter "$policyType -like 'tenant:$policy'"
Get-CsOnlineUser -Filter "$policyType -eq 'tenant:$policy'"
Get-CsOnlineUser -Filter "$policyType -like 'host:$policy'"
Get-CsOnlineUser -Filter "$policyType -eq 'host:$policy'"
# This returns users with all custom policies
Get-CsOnlineUser -Filter "$policyType -like 'tenant:*'"
# This returns users with all default policies (except global)
Get-CsOnlineUser -Filter "$policyType -like 'host:*'"
```

I did not find a way to get users with global policy using comparison statements. Worry not, script block to the rescue!

## Script block for Filter property

The majority of the comparison statements can be translated into a script block. Let's look at the examples from the previous section.

```powershell
# Return users with the specified policy
Get-CsOnlineUser -Filter {TeamsEventsPolicy -like 'Allow Town Halls'}
Get-CsOnlineUser -Filter {TeamsEventsPolicy -eq 'Allow Town Halls'}
```

For `-like` wildcards are supported:

```powershell
# Includes all policies starting with 'Allow Town Halls'
Get-CsOnlineUser -Filter {TeamsEventsPolicy -like 'Allow Town Halls*'}
# Ending with 'Allow Town Halls'
Get-CsOnlineUser -Filter {TeamsEventsPolicy -like '*Allow Town Halls'}
# Or containing 'Allow Town Halls'
Get-CsOnlineUser -Filter {TeamsEventsPolicy -like '*Allow Town Halls*'}
```

*Tenant* and *host* types work, too:

```powershell
# Users with global policy are not returned in any case below
Get-CsOnlineUser -Filter {TeamsEventsPolicy -like 'tenant:Allow Town Halls'}
Get-CsOnlineUser -Filter {TeamsEventsPolicy -eq 'tenant:Allow Town Halls'}
Get-CsOnlineUser -Filter {TeamsCallingPolicy -like 'host:AllowCalling'}
Get-CsOnlineUser -Filter {TeamsCallingPolicy -eq 'host:AllowCalling'}
# This returns users with all custom policies
Get-CsOnlineUser -Filter {TeamsEventsPolicy -like 'tenant:*'}
# This returns users with all default policies (except global)
Get-CsOnlineUser -Filter {TeamsCallingPolicy -like 'host:*'}
```

## Users with global policy

One special exception that can be achieved only using script block is getting users with default policy (*Global*):

```powershell
# Works
Get-CsOnlineUser -Filter {TeamsCallingPolicy -eq $null}
```

## Passing variable to the script block

You might have noticed that in script block examples we are not passing the variable. It does not work out of the box:

```powershell
# Will not work
Get-CsOnlineUser -Filter {$policyType -eq $policyName}
```

Why? We can try to run the script block in PowerShell. We will see that the variable reference is treated as text:

```powershell
{$policyType -eq $policyName}
# Will return
PS> $policyType -eq $policyName
```

The screenshot shows the output:

![Syntax error first and then script block transferred to text](../../img/teams-users-by-policy/20231206-171121-D1TjIxa40W.png)

There is a workaround that we can use. We need to construct the script block first. Then we provide it to the *Filter* property: 

```powershell
$policyType = 'TeamsEventsPolicy'
$policyName = 'Allow Town Halls'
# For getting users with default policy
$scriptBlockGlobal = 
	[System.Management.Automation.ScriptBlock]::Create("$policyType" +' -eq $null')
Get-CsOnlineUser -Filter $scriptBlockGlobal

# For other filters
$scriptBlock = 
	[System.Management.Automation.ScriptBlock]::Create("$policyType -eq '$policyName'")
Get-CsOnlineUser -Filter $scriptBlock
```

## Summary

Filtering by policies in Teams PowerShell is not trivial. Having a bit of knowledge about script blocks and filter queries. Even with this, some cases might be not as easy as we think.
