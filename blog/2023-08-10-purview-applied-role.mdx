When fixing issues with roles, we frequently are not sure, which role is currently active and which is not. We can wait 15-30 mins to be sure that roles are updated. But is there a more efficient way?

I recently came into that issue. This time in Purview. I got *Audit Reader* role, but did not see any audit entries. After digging into my browser dev tools, I found a workaround. I'm sharing it below.

## Preparing Developer Tools

Let's start with basics. We need to sign-in to [Purview](https://compliance.microsoft.com/) first.

<Tip>

Do you already know [msportals.io](https://msportals.io/)? If not, check it out. You will be grateful next time you need to find any from multiple Microsoft admin portals.

</Tip>

From Purview main page, let's now open Developer Tools (DevTools). I usually use *Ctrl + Shift + I* or *F12*. Both works in Edge, Firefox and Chrome.

<Tip>

The screenshots below are from Edge. The experience in other browsers will be similar, but not identical.

</Tip>

For me, it's easier to navigate DevTools in separate window. Let's switch the view:

In DevTools, let's now switch to the **Network** tab (1). We can also disable cache (2) to make sure all requests are sent once again:

## Generating the request

Now we need to force our browser to ask for the roles assigned to our account. To do this, let's go to audit log search. You can either click *Audit* from the left menu or use [direct link to Audit page](https://compliance.microsoft.com/auditlogsearch?viewid=Async%20Search).

Our DevTools will show plenty of requests. But we are interested in one: *GetUserRolesWithScopeInfo*. Let's put that phrase into the search box (1). Then we click the request from the list (2) and go to **Preview** tab (3):

<Warning>

In Firefox, there is no **Preview** tab. The preview is incorporated into the **Response** tab.

</Warning>

We're almost there. Now let's expand *GrantedByRoleGroupInfos* property. We will get the list of roles assigned:

![All the roles listed in the response preview](../../img/purview-applied-role/20230810-213636-ya4WEYjCde.png)

<Tip>

In Edge/Chrome you can right-click and choose **Expand recursively**.

</Tip>

## Summary

We used DevTools to dig into low-level request sent by Purview. But the roles is not the only thing we can find there. How about exploring it a little more?

Make sure to share any interesting things you found. I suggest the comments section below. Happy exploring!
