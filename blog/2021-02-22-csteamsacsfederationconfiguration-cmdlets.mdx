Two new cmdlets appeared in Skype for Business Online PowerShell module. They are related with upcoming integration with Azure Communication Services.

## Description

There's no existing documentation for these cmdlets so we only can guess, what it's supposed to be doing. My guess is that it's for controlling integration with [Azure Communication Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/communication-services/), currently in preview.

### Azure Communication Services

Integration of Teams with ACS will allow us to join apps created with ACS to Teams meetings. You'll have options to join IM-only or with calling functionalities (voice and video). It might provide a way to integrate different communication platforms with Teams meetings.

## Default settings

```powershell
PS> Get-CsTeamsAcsFederationConfiguration


Identity             : Global
AllowedAcsResources  : {}
BlockedAcsResources  : {}
EnableAcsUsers       : True
AllowAllAcsResources : True
```

## Available parameters

Parameters available for `Set-CsTeamsAcsFederationConfiguration` are as follows. The name is followed by accepted data type and my guess of its meaning:

* **Identity** \<XdsIdentity\> - I suppose the description of this will be: *The only valid input is Global - the tenant wide configuration* similarly to other `Set-*Configuration` cmdlets
* **AllowedAcsResources** \<PSListModifier[string]\> - if specified, it'll provide list of allowed apps for ACS integration
* **AllowAllAcsResources** \<bool\> - By default set to `True`, which means all the resources will be allowed
* **BlockedAcsResources** \<PSListModifier[string]\> if specified, it'll provide list of blocked apps for ACS integration
* **EnableAcsUsers** \<bool\> - any ideas for that one? ðŸ¤”
* **Tenant** \<guid\> - most likely *Internal Microsoft use only*

Usage of `PSListModifier` type means that to add/remove values from the list we'll have to use the following syntax:

```powershell
# Add to the list of allowed resources
-AllowedAcsResources @{Add="ResourceA","ResourceB","ResourceC"}
# Remove from the list of allowed resources
-AllowedAcsResources @{Remove="ResourceD"}
# And so on
```

Other optional parameters:

* Force
* WhatIf
* Confirm
* \<CommonParameters\>
