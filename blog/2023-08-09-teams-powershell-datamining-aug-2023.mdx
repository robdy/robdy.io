At the beginning of August Microsoft released the 5.5.0 version of the Microsoft Teams PowerShell module.

## Release notes

The [official release notes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/teams-powershell-release-notes) mention the following changes:

* Releases New-CsTeamsHiddenTemplate cmdlet.
* Releases [New|Get|Set|Remove]-CsTeamsTemplatePermissionPolicy cmdlets.
* Adds a new paramater -IncludePhoneNumbers to Get-CsTenantNetworkSite.
* [BREAKING CHANGE] Deprecates EnableShiftPresence parameter from TeamsShiftsPolicy.

* Contains a new implementation of [Get|Set]-CsTeamsUpgradeConfiguration, [Get|Set|Remove|New]-CsTeamsComplianceRecordingPolicy, [Get|Set|Remove|New]-CsTeamsComplianceRecordingApplication, New-CsTeamsComplianceRecordingPairedApplication. Functionality remains the same as previous implementation.

However, there is more. Let's talk about them!

## Custom prompts

The most mysterious feature comes first. We're getting custom prompts along with a custom prompt package. The cmdlets are:

* *New-CsCustomPrompt*
* *New-CsCustomPromptPackage*

For the custom prompt itself, we can set the following properties:

* *AudioPrompt*
* *Id*
* *Locale*
* *Name*
* *TextPrompt*
* *Type*

All the parameters accept strings. Only three of them are mandatory: *Id*, *Type*, and *Locale*.

The policy package contains the following properties:

* *Id*
* *DefaultLocale*
* *Name*
* *InboundEndRecordingPrompt*
* *InboundStartRecordingPrompt*
* *MeetingEndRecordingPrompt*
* *MeetingStartRecordingPrompt*
* *OutboundEndRecordingPrompt*
* *OutboundStartRecordingPrompt*

*Id*, *DefaultLocale*, and *Name* accept string values. Recording prompt values accepts *PSListModifier[string]* type. From the documentation of [PSListModifier](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.pslistmodifier?view=powershellsdk-7.3.0), we will be able to supply multiple prompts for each type.

Unfortunately, we cannot test it yet. Both *New-CsCustomPrompt* and *New-CsCustomPromptPackage* cmdlets currently return the same error:

> *Could not find the resource "XsdClassGeneratorStringsResources.resources" among the resources "" embedded in the assembly "Microsoft.Teams.Policy.Administration.Cmdlets.Providers.PolicyRp", nor among the resources in any satellite assemblies for the specified culture. Perhaps the resources were embedded with an incorrect name.*

## Custom audio conferencing prompts

We get two more new cmdlets containing *custom prompts* in their names:

* *Get-CsTeamsAudioConferencingCustomPromptsConfiguration*
* *Set-CsTeamsAudioConferencingCustomPromptsConfiguration*

The *Set-* cmdlet accepts:

* *Identity* - mandatory, accepts a string
* *Packages* - optional, accepts *PSListModifier[CustomPromptPackage]*
* *Prompts* - optional, accepts *PSListModifier[CustomPrompt]*

Similar to custom prompt packages, we will be able to add multiple prompts using `@{Add='Identifier'}` method.

For now, both *Get-* and *Set-* cmdlets return an error:

> *Provided type TeamsAudioConferencingCustomPromptsConfiguration is not valid Please check your request parameters.*

## Compliance recording policy

*New-CsTeamsComplianceRecordingPolicy* and *Set-CsTeamsComplianceRecordingPolicy* now have three new parameters:

* *CustomPromptsEnabled*
* *CustomPromptsPackageId*
* *RecordReroutedCalls*

*CustomPromptsEnabled* and *RecordReroutedCalls* accepts a boolean value. They both default to *false*. Setting both parameters already work:

![A screenshot showing both parameters can be changed](../../img/teams-powershell-datamining-aug-2023/20230808-075642-xFX2UtsxYx.png)

*CustomPromptsPackageId* accepts a string. We can assume it will need a package identifier from *New-CsCustomPromptPackage*. The default value is an empty string.

When trying to provide an identifier we get the same error message as for *New-CsCustomPrompt* and *New-CsCustomPromptPackage*:

![Error when using CustomPromptsPackageId parameter](../../img/teams-powershell-datamining-aug-2023/20230808-075251-rxQxFMgj0a.png)

* ❌No roadmap mention
* ❌No Message Center mention

Checklist for *RecordReroutedCalls*:

* ✅Documentation updated
* ❌No roadmap mention
* ❌No Message Center mention

## Events policy

*New-CsTeamsEventsPolicy* and *Set-CsTeamsEventsPolicy* now have three new parameters:

* *AllowedTownhallTypesForRecordingPublish*
* *AllowedWebinarTypesForRecordingPublish*
* *TownhallChatExperience*

*Get-CsTeamsEventsPolicy* cmdlet already returns these parameters.

*AllowedTownhallTypesForRecordingPublish* and *AllowedWebinarTypesForRecordingPublish* both default to *Everyone*. They both accept the following values:

* *None*
* *InviteOnly*
* *EveryoneInCompanyIncludingGuests*
* *Everyone*

How can we check it? We can pass a random value and inspect the error:

![Error message showing possible values](../../img/teams-powershell-datamining-aug-2023/20230808-081811-hAp1lIXIGM.png)

For *TownhallChatExperience* it is not that easy. It accepts any string value and does not return any error. However, it effectively does nothing: 

![Setting TownhallChatExperience does not work yet](../../img/teams-powershell-datamining-aug-2023/20230808-082110-Ufx308NDqK.png)

In events policies, the word *townhall* refers to Live Events. That gives us some ideas. For webinars, we already know about on-demand recording ([123052](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/roadmap?searchterms=123052), [MC661825](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/MessageCenter/:/messages/MC661825)). We will get similar functionality for Live Events, but it is not announced.

We will also get chat functionality in Live Events, which is big news. However, no details are available about the timeline or functional details.

## Meeting policy

*New-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy* and *Set-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy* now have two new parameters:

- *AllowLocalRecording* - accepts boolean value, defaults to *false*
- *ConnectToMeetingControls - accepts string, defaults to empty string*

*Get-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy* cmdlet already returns these properties.

From the first parameter’s name, it might seem that we will have the option to store recordings locally. Zoom has a [similar parameter in the SDK](https://marketplacefront.zoom.us/sdk/meeting/electron/module-zoom_meeting_recording.html). I can see one big pro of local recordings - they will not expire. However, [this Pull Request](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/office-docs-powershell/pull/11144) suggests that the parameter is for Microsoft internal use only.

The other property suggests connecting to meeting controls by something that does not natively belong to Teams. Is it for [Elgato Steam Deck](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/healthcare-and-life-sciences/update-teams-powerpoint-plugins-for-elgato-stream-deck-and/ba-p/3767650) or for something else? We don’t know yet.

## Shared calling routing policy

The routing policy for shared calling is a new type of policy introduced in the 5.5.0 release. The entire set of cmdlets is already available:

- *Get-CsTeamsSharedCallingRoutingPolicy*
- *New-CsTeamsSharedCallingRoutingPolicy*
- *Remove-CsTeamsSharedCallingRoutingPolicy*
- *Set-CsTeamsSharedCallingRoutingPolicy*
- *Grant-CsTeamsSharedCallingRoutingPolicy*

Granting policy to a group is available with the *-Group* and *-Rank* parameters for *Grant-* cmdlet. The policy contains the following configurable parameters (via *New-* and *Set-*):

- *Description* - accepts a string, defaults to an empty string
- *EmergencyNumbers* - accepts *PSListModifier[string]*, defaults to an empty object
- *Identity* - required, accepts a string
- *ResourceAccount* - required, accepts a string

*Get-CsTeamsSharedCallingRoutingPolicy* cmdlet already returns these parameters. However, seting or creating anything ends with our well-known error:

![Error running any of the shared calling routing policy cmdlets](T../../img/teams-powershell-datamining-aug-2023/20230809-074758-TicBN7Z1sW.png)

I found an announcement that might be related to this policy. Its title is *Call delegation feature enhancements*. It is described as *the ability for delegates and delegators to join active calls, if permitted*. Roadmap item [123753](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&searchterms=123753) and Message Center entry [MC649047](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?ref=MessageCenter/:/messages/MC649047) ([non-admin mirror](https://west.jcteams.info/jcteamsinfo/docs/MC649047.html)) describe it quite well.

## Voice applications policy

*New-CsTeamsVoiceApplicationsPolicy* and *Set-CsTeamsVoiceApplicationsPolicy* get three new parameters:

- HistoricalAgentMetricsPermission
- HistoricalAutoAttendantMetricsPermission
- HistoricalCallQueueMetricsPermission

The default value for all three parameters is *Disabled*. The available values are:

- *Disabled*
- *AuthorizedOnly*
- *All*

*Get-CsTeamsVoiceApplicationsPolicy* cmdlet already returns these parameters. Surprisingly, all the parameters are already described in the  [Manage voice applications policies for Microsoft Teams](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/manage-voice-applications-policies) article.

Checklist for new parameters:

- ✅Documentation already available

## Network site ID

*NetworkSiteID* parameter is now available for *Get-CsPhoneNumberAssignment* and *Set-CsPhoneNumberAssignment*.

It is currently unknown what is the site identified for. Is it possible that the number assignment will be dynamic, based on the network? 

Checklist for *NetworkSiteID*:

- ❌Documentation not available
- ❌Ambiguous results on search engines
- ❌Ambiguous results on GitHub
- ❌No roadmap mention
- ❌No Message Center mention

<Warning>

Searching for this parameter is difficult as there are other cmdlets using it. Therefore, the checklist might be misleading.

</Warning>

## Upgrade configuration

*Set-CsTeamsUpgradeConfiguration* gets one new parameter: *BlockLegacyAuthorization*. It accepts a boolean value. Its default value is *false*.

The parameter was already visible in *Get-CsTeamsUpgradeConfiguration* since May 2023. However, it is still unclear what it does.

There is plenty of articles on the web showing [how to block legacy authentication (using Conditional Access)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/block-legacy-authentication). However, the parameter name is about authorization, which is [a different topic](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-vs-authorization).

## Summary

Quite a long article, isn’t it? But that is because there were plenty of *hidden* features introduced in this version.

Which one do you find the most interesting? Let me know in the comments if you want!
