Microsoft silently adds many new cmdlets and parameters. Below you can find my first attempt to summarize what was added in last three months to Teams PowerShell module.

## New cmdlets

Related with Azure Communication Service federation:

- Get-CsTeamsAcsFederationConfiguration
- Set-CsTeamsAcsFederationConfiguration

Check my [blog post](https://robdy.io/csteamsacsfederationconfiguration-cmdlets/) for details.

Next ones sound like something related to the ability to limit certain workloads (audio, video, screensharing etc.) for selected users:

- Get-CsTeamsWorkLoadPolicy
- Grant-CsTeamsWorkLoadPolicy
- New-CsTeamsWorkLoadPolicy
- Remove-CsTeamsWorkLoadPolicy
- Set-CsTeamsWorkLoadPolicy

Custom policy packages cmdlets (currently in [public preview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/manage-policy-packages#custom-policy-packages)):

- New-CsCustomPolicyPackage
- Remove-CsCustomPolicyPackage
- Update-CsCustomPolicyPackage

Teams templates-related cmdlets:

- New-CsTeamTemplate
- Remove-CsTeamTemplate
- Update-CsTeamTemplate

> **NOTE**: Learn more about Teams templates by checking [Get started with Teams templates in the admin center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/get-started-with-teams-templates-in-the-admin-console).

Cmdlets for package assignment policies (I honestly have no idea what vertical package is, do you?):

- New-CsTeamsVerticalPackagePolicy
- Remove-CsTeamsVerticalPackagePolicy
- Set-CsTeamsVerticalPackagePolicy

`Grant-CsGroupPolicyPackageAssignment` will be for assigning package policy via group.

And these two not documented yet:

- **Move-CsInternalHelper** - probably something around moving data from one user. I'd guess it's internal MS cmdlet.
- **Set-CsInternalOnlinePowerShellEndpoint** - might be related to connection settings.

## New params for cmdlets

In addition to cmdlets, we also have quite a few new params added for existing cmdlets. Let's break them down into categories.

## Dial-in conferencing

Under `Get-CsOnlineDialinConferencingTenantConfiguration` there's one new param: `ThirdPartyNumberStatus`. Does it mean that Microsoft is going to give us third party ACP option back? As a reminder, here's [End of life program announcement](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/skypeforbusiness/legal-and-regulatory/end-of-integration-with-3rd-party-providers).

## Applications

For `Get-CsTeamsAppSetupPolicy` we got `AppPresetMeetingList`. My guess - we'll be able to specify set of applications for meetings. Related with [Teams Calls & Meetings API in Graph rollout](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams/the-new-microsoft-teams-calls-amp-meetings-api-in-graph-what/td-p/266938).

## Feedback

For `Get-CsTeamsFeedbackPolicy` we get the following params:

- AllowScreenshotCollection
- AllowEmailCollection
- AllowLogCollection

It indicates some new option to gather feedback are coming. We can already see it in the [Roadmap item 68880](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&searchterms=68880). Message Center got its own entry: **MC233962**.

## Meetings

Under `Get-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy` we got the following new params:

- AllowMeetingRegistration
- WhoCanRegister

The above are related to invite-only meetings, which were announced on Ignite. By the way, have you already checked [Microsoft Ignite 2021 Book of News](https://news.microsoft.com/ignite-march-2021-book-of-news/)?

There are additional two params, which are currently not easy to guess what they do:

- AllowTrackingInReport
- AllowCarbonSummary

The latter might be related with [Microsoft Sustainability Calculator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sustainability/sustainability-guide/sustainability-calculator) which allows you to calculate your carbon footprint based on services you use.

## Messaging

For `Get-CsTeamsMessagingPolicy` we got:

`AllowSmartCompose` - it's a feature currently available for Outlook Web App, which gives us text prediction, suggesed replies [and more](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-intelligent-technology-in-outlook-on-the-web-and-outlook-com-24b30683-8340-4b69-b8ac-4193ec528a70).

`AllowFluidCollaborate` - it seems like Fluid framework is going to be implemented in Teams. It's currently in preview and I haven't played with that a lot, but you can [check it yourself](https://fluidpreview.office.net/).

## Compliance recording

We'll be able to disable audio notification about meeting being recorded (applies only to PSTN calls) by using:
`DisableComplianceRecordingAudioNotificationForCalls` for `Set-CsTeamsComplianceRecordingPolicy`.

## Skype Broadcast and Live Events

New parameters related with eCDN providers for Skype for Business Broadcast and Live Events are available:

- SdnProviderName
- SdnLicenseId
- SdnApiTemplateUrl
- SdnApiToken

for both `Get-CsBroadcastMeetingConfiguration` and `Get-CsTeamsMeetingBroadcastConfiguration`

Additionally, Teams Live Events are getting `SdnAzureSubscriptionId` parameter.

Do you find that type of articles interested? If so, let me know by commenting below or via Twitter/LinkedIn (links at the bottom). If you have any guesses what the parameters/cmdlets might be for, let me know and I'll add them to the article (with proper credits, of course).
