## When will Teams Live Events retire?

The [announcement post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/introducing-town-halls-in-microsoft-teams-and-retiring-microsoft/ba-p/3925739) describes the retirement timeline for Live Events:

> After **September 30, 2024**, Teams Live Events will no longer be supported, and access will be discontinued. Customers will not be able to schedule, start, or join any events on Teams Live Events after this date. Existing recordings will be available to access until **December 31, 2024**.

For government customers, the date is yet to be announced.

It is currently not clear what will be the limits for Live Events in 2024. Currently, limits are [temporarily increased](https://aka.ms/Stream/Blog/LiveEventOptions) until December 31, 2023. That includes:

* Event support for up to 20,000 attendees
* 50 events can be hosted simultaneously across a tenant

* Event duration of 16 hours per broadcast
* Live events with up to 100,000 attendees planned through the Microsoft 365 Live Event Assistance Program

## What is the green room experience for Town Halls?

In the [announcement post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/introducing-town-halls-in-microsoft-teams-and-retiring-microsoft/ba-p/3925739) we have the green room experience screenshot:

We can see controls to start and end the meeting. We also have the red rectangle showing the content that will be presented to attendees when the meeting starts.

## What are the admin settings for Team Hall in Teams?

All the settings about Town Halls are held in the Teams events policy. They can be changed using [Set-CsTeamsEventsPolicy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/teams/set-csteamseventspolicy?view=teams-ps) cmdlet. The available settings are:

* *AllowTownhalls* - can either be *Enabled* (default value) or *Disabled*
* *AllowedTownhallTypesForRecordingPublish* - possible values are *None*, *InviteOnly*, *EveryoneInCompanyIncludingGuests*, *Everyone* (default value)

* *TownhallChatExperience* - can be *Optimized* (default value) or *None*
The setting to allow town halls is self-explanatory. The *AllowedTownhallTypesForRecordingPublish* manages types of Town Hall where attendees can have recordings published.

Chat experience setting controls whether the town hall organizer can enable *Comment Stream* chat experience.

## Summary

Town Hall seems to be a promising feature, solving the main issue we had with Live Events - a different interface. Will it fulfill the expectations? We shall see in the upcoming weeks.
