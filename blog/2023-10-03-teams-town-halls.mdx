Microsoft announced Town Halls at the end of September 2023. Let's gather everything we know about it.

## What is Town Hall in Teams?

Town Hall is the name of a new virtual experience for big meetings. This is also the functionality that replaces Teams Live Events in 2024.

Below you can find the list of features available for Town Halls:

* Unified experience similar to Teams meetings

* ðŸ’ŽTeams Premium adds German, Italian, Korean, and Russian for translated captions

## What are the limitations of Town Halls?

* Up to 10,000 attendees (ðŸ’Ž20,000 in Teams Premium)
* Up to 15 concurrent events across the tenant (ðŸ’Ž50 in Teams Premium)
* Maximum duration of the event: 30 hours

## How do you create a Town Hall in Teams?

To create a Town Hall, go to calendar in Teams and choose **Town hall** from the **New meeting** dropdown:

![Choosing Town Hall from the New meeting dropdown](/../../img/teams-town-halls/20231009-062358-X4bRviMot6.png)

If you do not see **Town hall** option, that functionality is blocked for you (or the entire organization) by an admin policy.

## When will Teams Live Events retire?

The [announcement post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/introducing-town-halls-in-microsoft-teams-and-retiring-microsoft/ba-p/3925739) describes the retirement timeline for Live Events:

> After **September 30, 2024**, Teams Live Events will no longer be supported, and access will be discontinued. Customers will not be able to schedule, start, or join any events on Teams Live Events after this date. Existing recordings will be available to access until **December 31, 2024**.

For government customers, the date is yet to be announced.

It is currently not clear what will be the limits for Live Events in 2024. Currently, limits are [temporarily increased](https://aka.ms/Stream/Blog/LiveEventOptions) until December 31, 2023. That includes:

* Event support for up to 20,000 attendees
* 50 events can be hosted simultaneously across a tenant
* Event duration of 16 hours per broadcast
* Live events with up to 100,000 attendees planned through the Microsoft 365 Live Event Assistance Program

## What is the green room experience for Town Halls?

In the [announcement post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/introducing-town-halls-in-microsoft-teams-and-retiring-microsoft/ba-p/3925739) we have the green room experience screenshot:

![Green room experience for Town Hall](../../img/teams-town-halls/green_room.png)

We can see controls to start and end the meeting. We also have the red rectangle showing the content that will be presented to attendees when the meeting starts.

## What are the admin settings for Team Hall in Teams?

All the settings about Town Halls are held in the Teams events policy. They can be changed using [Set-CsTeamsEventsPolicy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/teams/set-csteamseventspolicy?view=teams-ps) cmdlet. The available settings are:

* _AllowTownhalls_ - can either be _Enabled_ (default value) or *Disabled*
* _AllowedTownhallTypesForRecordingPublish_ - possible values are _None_, _InviteOnly_, _EveryoneInCompanyIncludingGuests_, _Everyone_ (default value)
* _TownhallChatExperience_ - can be _Optimized_ (default value) or _None_
The setting to allow town halls is self-explanatory. The _AllowedTownhallTypesForRecordingPublish_ manages types of Town Hall where attendees can have recordings published.

Chat experience setting controls whether the town hall organizer can enable _Comment Stream_ chat experience.

## Summary

Town Hall seems to be a promising feature, solving the main issue we had with Live Events - a different interface. Will it fulfill the expectations? We shall see in the upcoming weeks.
